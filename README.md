## **Features**

### **Daily Challenges (Flow 1)**
- Engage in three random mini-games daily from a pool of nine games, including:
  - **Memory Card Game**: Tests recall and attention to detail.
  - **Numbers Game**: Challenges quick math and problem-solving.
  - **Space Shapes**: Enhances reaction speed and spatial awareness.

### **Extra Demo Games (Flow 2)**
- These games are part of the full vision for the app and are accessible via **Flow 2: Extra Demo** in the Figma prototype. While not interactive in this prototype, they showcase additional gameplay concepts:
  - **Connect the Dots Maze**: Connect dots in the shortest time possible without numbers to guide you. Connections are vertical or horizontal, with no overlaps.
  - **Spike Ball Puzzle**: Tilt your phone to control a rolling spike ball and destroy balloons in a physics-based environment.
  - **RPG Stats Builder**: Allocate character stats in 40 seconds and battle a boss or monster using strategic elements like Attack, Defense, and Magic.
  - **Pattern Recall**: Memorize sprite patterns in a retro-inspired level with anime-style visuals.
  - **Color Mix & Match**: Blend colors to match a target shade. Background scripts analyze user behavior to detect potential color blindness.
  - **Word Puzzle Scramble**: Form as many words as possible from scrambled letters under a time limit, enhancing vocabulary and quick thinking.

### **Fidget Mode**
- Inspired by Tamagotchi, this mode provides stress relief and dopamine dumping through interactive elements like:
  - **Popcat**: Mimics popping bubble wrap for psychological satisfaction.
  - **Pikachu**: Vibrates the phone for a relaxing hand massage (demo only; full version will feature unique, original characters).

### **Adaptive Features** *(Planned for Full Version)*
- **Sanctuary Mode**: A meditation mode activated via Bluetooth headphones.
- **Anxiety and Disability Detection**: Subtle analysis of gameplay to suggest professional advice for users with dyslexia, color blindness, or other potential cognitive challenges.
